# CataractPrediction

### Dated:
Boston University, Fall 2022

### Description:
The “Ocular Disease Recognition” dataset has been taken up from Kaggle. Link to dataset: ocular disease recognition It has images of around 5000 patients with age, color fundus photographs from left and right eyes and the doctor’s diagnostic keywords. They classify patient into 8 labels including:
1. Normal (N),
2. Diabetes (D),
3. Glaucoma (G),
4. Cataract (C),
5. Age related Macular Degeneration (A),
6. Hypertension (H),
7. Pathological Myopia (M),
8. Other diseases/abnormalities (O)

I have used the dataset to make predictions for Cataract using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).

### Achievements:
● Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to develop a Cataract Prediction model 

● Employed hyperparameter experimentation, model fine-tuning, and optimization techniques to achieve a predictive accuracy rate of 88%
